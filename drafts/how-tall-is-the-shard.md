title: How tall is The Shard?
layout: draft
---
[According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shard), The Shard (the tallest building in the UK) stands "309.6 meters (1,016 feet) high". I put this in my Anki deck as "Height of The Shard / 310m", but I was saying "height" to mean "tallness" (because I don't much like that word) and I had assumed Wikipedia was using it the same way. So I thought The Shard was 310 m tall.

But [according to Bron Maher in Londonist](https://londonist.com/london/secret/shard-not-tallest-building-in-london-crystal-palace-transmitter-is),

> most sources put the buildingâ€™s tallness - that is, its length base-to-tip - at about 306 metres. The last three metres come from the height of the ground on which The Shard is built. So while its height is indeed 309 metres above sea level, The Shard is only 306 metres tall.

Is that so? I was curious enough to investigate[^hills], but it turns out I don't really know how to.

[^hills]: The main point of the article is to teach us that there's a [point in London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_transmitting_station) higher than the tip of the Shard. I find that mildly interesting, but not very surprising, since I'm aware of the concept of hills. But "actually this building is less tall than you think because people keep giving its height instead of its tallness" is... kinda surprising, if true, but in a not-very-surprising way.

(Also: Maher says The Shard is 306 m, not 309 m, not "not 310 m". And he gets 309 from Wikipedia, quoting it on the [list of highest points in London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest_points_in_London), which talks about "the 309 m (1,014 ft) tall Shard". Where did those extra 60 cm go? The article on The Shard itself also has that number, in the "records" section near the bottom. So is it 306 m, 309 m, or 309.6 m?)

My approach was to google both "how tall is the shard" and "height above sea level of the shard", and here are some of the results:

[The London Pass](https://londonpass.com/en-us/blog/facts-about-the-shard): "The Shard is 306 metres tall, however if you measure all the way up to the tip, it's 310 metres". I don't know what point below the tip it's talking about.

[The Skyscraper Center](https://www.skyscrapercenter.com/building/the-shard/451): height ("measured from the level of the lowest, significant, open-air, pedestrian entrance") is "306 m / 1,004 ft", both "to tip" and "architectural". (The difference being things like flagpoles and antennae, which the Shard doesn't have. The highest occupied floor is "244.3 m / 802 ft".) Seems like the kind of site that knows what it's talking about. Doesn't cite sources, but the drawing they have is labeled a [CTBUH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_on_Tall_Buildings_and_Urban_Habitat), and that also sounds like the kind of organization that knows what it's talking about.

[SkyscraperCity](https://www.skyscrapercity.com/threads/the-shard-southwark-309m-72-fl.407549/page-833): says both "309m" and "310m" with no apparent shame. But also, that link points to page 833 of 1385 of a discussion thread, and at this particular point people are discussing its height above sea level. (And comparing to the then-future "The Pinnacle", which became [22 Bishopsgate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/22_Bishopsgate). It seems The Shard is level with The Thames nearby, which at that point is tidal. Some commenters think that means it's at sea level, but someone else points out no: "A river can be tidal some distance above high water mark for the sea. Consider what happens when the tide comes in - the sea effectively "comes up" the river mouth, which will slow down flow of water down the river, which will start backing up. As it backs up, the level upstream will increase as less water is getting out. Thus a river can be tidal above the high tide point of the sea itself." Makes sense to me.

Someone else says it's 16 m above sea level according to Google Maps, but I can't find that info on Google Maps myself. (But it does label it as "306m-high glass & steel tower with views", if I'm zoomed in the right amount. I can't see that string anywhere else.)

Another says it's 16 m above sea level, according to "the Ordinance Datum figures". Presumably they mean [ordnance datum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnance_datum); that's not a source, their point is to talk about "what is the zero-point that this is 16 m above".[^zero-point] (In different comments they say 16 or 17 m, but I'm pretty sure they mean 16.)

[^zero-point]: [Apparently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnance_Survey) the zero point actually changed in 2016, and now things are defined to be about 25mm higher above sea level than they used to be.

On the next page, someone links to a nearby [ordnance survey benchmark](https://www.bench-marks.org.uk/bm35265) which seemingly puts the ground there at 4.563 m above sea level. (But we get 3dp precision for the height of the mark above sea level, and only 1dp precision for its height above ground level, which is sus. Probably best stick to 4.5 m above sea level, and then The Shard would be somewhat close to that unless there are steps or a steep hill in between, and I'm sure there are some nearby.) (The benchmarks site doesn't have an FAQ entry for "what actually are these things we've catalogued so painstakingly", so [here's Ordnance Survey explianing them](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/benchmarks/). I think "cut mark" just means "we marked the location by making a cut in the wall somewhere".)

Someone else on the next page says Bing Maps has an Ordnance Survey overlay. [Looking at that](https://www.bing.com/maps?osid=1f680cdc-fe2f-4342-9d6f-3fd70147d883&cp=51.505065~-0.089808&lvl=16.296453&pi=0&v=2&sV=2&form=S00027): The Shard is contained in a fairly small contour line, but that line isn't marked with a height. The next-nearest contour I can find is marked 10 (which is in meters), so this one could be either 5 or 15, making both 16 m and "somewhat close to 4.5 m" plausible, which is frankly ridiculous.

If I google "uk contour lines" I get [this map](https://en-gb.topographic-map.com/map-kb57/England/?center=51.50389%2C-0.08613&zoom=16&popup=51.50438%2C-0.08684). It doesn't have The Shard actually labeled, but clicking various points inside its outline I can get between 15 and 20 m. I don't think there's actually a 5 m difference between different corners of the base of The Shard, so this seems unreliable. Points near the benchmark seem to be about 12-15 m.

But I couldn't find anything else for free. [This site](https://www.mapserve.co.uk/blog/1m-contours-launched) might help, but I'd need to register for an account and I'm not sure that would be enough.

Oh! This is kind of embarrassing to admit, but even though I go by The Shard pretty often I don't have a good sense of the road layout near it, or indeed which building in the road layout is The Shard. But scrolling around street view for a bit to refresh my memory, I realize it has ground-level exits on at least two different floors, with an [outside escalator](https://goo.gl/maps/yVnw4oYVeZUzmNdq5) that's probably something around 10 m elevation. (On screen it's about 4.5x the height of that guy, so I'd guess a bit under.) So actually, a 5 m difference between corners is totally reasonable; what counts as "ground level" when you're inside a building like that? Still, the previous map seems to be wrong about the benchmark.

Meanwhile Maher's 3 m figure for the height of the ground seems to come from taking someone at OS saying the top of The Shard is 308.9 m, and subtracting from that the 306 m of The Shard itself.

So... I'm not sure, really. But my current guess is that he's just right. The Shard is 306 m tall. Its lowest ground floor is about 3 m above sea level. It then also has a ground floor significantly higher than that, though probably not quite 16 m.
