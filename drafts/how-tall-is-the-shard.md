title: How tall is the Shard?
layout: draft
---
[According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shard), the Shard (the tallest building in the UK) stands "309.6 meters (1,016 feet) high". I put this in my Anki deck as "Height of the Shard / 310m", but I was saying "height" to mean "tallness" (because I don't much like that word) and I had assumed Wikipedia was using it the same way. So I thought the Shard was 310 m tall.

But [according to Bron Maher in Londonist](https://londonist.com/london/secret/shard-not-tallest-building-in-london-crystal-palace-transmitter-is),

> most sources put the buildingâ€™s tallness - that is, its length base-to-tip - at about 306 metres. The last three metres come from the height of the ground on which the Shard is built. So while its height is indeed 309 metres above sea level, the Shard is only 306 metres tall.

Is that so? I was curious enough to investigate[^hills], but it turns out I don't really know how to.

[^hills]: The main point of the article is to teach us that there's a [point in London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_transmitting_station) higher than the tip of the Shard. I find that mildly interesting, but not very surprising, since I'm aware of the concept of hills. But "actually this building is less tall than you think because people keep giving its height instead of its tallness" is... kinda surprising, if true, but in a not-very-surprising way.

(Also: Maher says the Shard is 306 m, not 309 m, not "not 310 m". And he gets 309 from Wikipedia, quoting it on the [list of highest points in London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest_points_in_London), which talks about "the 309 m (1,014 ft) tall Shard". Where did those extra 60 cm go? The article on the Shard itself also has that number, in the "records" section near the bottom, but the infobox on the right has 309.6/1,016. So is it 306 m, 309 m, or 309.6 m?)

The first thing to do[^first] is to look at Wikipedia's sources. It doesn't have one on the list of highest points, and it doesn't have one in the "records" section. The infobox does have a source for the height, which is on [skyscraperpage.com](https://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=2611). It lists the spire at 1,016 ft or 309.7 m, yet another number! There are various drawings, all giving the spire at 309.7 m. (1,016 ft is 309.68 m, but 309.6 m is 1015.75 ft and 309.7 m is 1,016.08 ft. So if you convert 309.6 m to feet and back to meters, you could get 309.7 m. But wikipedia shouldn't be taking 309.6 m from that page.) But it lists the source for the height as http://www.the-shard.com, and [the about page](https://www.the-shard.com/about/) on that site says: "How tall is The Shard? The Shard is 309.6 metres, or 1,016 feet, high and is Western Europe's tallest building." You'd certainly expect the Shard's official webpage to be right about this, but also it says "high" not "tall" so it could be a misdirect.

[^first]: Not the first thing I actually did, but I feel a bit embarrassed I didn't think of it sooner.

Next[^next], does Maher have any sources? For 306 m tallness he just says "most sources" give that figure, which seems wrong to me. For 3 m above sea level, I think that comes from its height at the top. He quotes someone at Ordnance Survey saying the top of the Shard is 308.9 m above sea level, which gives around 3 m for the base.

[^next]: Also not actually next.

Most of my research was just googling things. Search terms included "how tall is the shard", "height above sea level of the shard", "the shard architectural drawings", "uk contour lines" and "cbtuh the shard" (inspired by one of the earlier results). Here are some of the things I found.

[The London Pass](https://londonpass.com/en-us/blog/facts-about-the-shard): "The Shard is 306 metres tall, however if you measure all the way up to the tip, it's 310 metres". I don't know what point below the tip it's talking about. The skyscraperpage drawings distinguish between spire and roof, but they give the roof at 304.2 m, not 306.

[The Skyscraper Center](https://www.skyscrapercenter.com/building/the-shard/451): height ("measured from the level of the lowest, significant, open-air, pedestrian entrance") is "306 m / 1,004 ft", both "to tip" and "architectural". (The difference being things like flagpoles and antennae, which the Shard doesn't have. The highest occupied floor is "244.3 m / 802 ft".) Seems like the kind of site that knows what it's talking about. Doesn't cite sources, but the drawing they have is labeled a [CTBUH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_on_Tall_Buildings_and_Urban_Habitat) drawing, and that also sounds like the kind of organization that knows what it's talking about, giving me a new google search term.

[SkyscraperCity](https://www.skyscrapercity.com/threads/the-shard-southwark-309m-72-fl.407549/page-833): says both "309m" and "310m" with no apparent shame. But also, that link points to page 833 of 1385 of a discussion thread[^fandom], and at this particular point people are discussing its height above sea level. (And comparing to the then-future "The Pinnacle", which became [22 Bishopsgate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/22_Bishopsgate).) It seems the Shard is level with The Thames nearby, which at that point is tidal. Some commenters think that means it's at sea level at least some of the time, but someone else points out no: "A river can be tidal some distance above high water mark for the sea. Consider what happens when the tide comes in - the sea effectively "comes up" the river mouth, which will slow down flow of water down the river, which will start backing up. As it backs up, the level upstream will increase as less water is getting out. Thus a river can be tidal above the high tide point of the sea itself." Makes sense to me.

[^fandom]: It's 22,770 posts as of December 2022. Apparently the skyscraper fandom means business.

Someone else says it's 16 m above sea level according to Google Maps, but I can't find that info on Google Maps myself. (But it does label it as "306m-high glass & steel tower with views", if I'm zoomed in the right amount. I can't see that string anywhere else.)

Another says it's 16 m above sea level, according to "the Ordinance Datum figures". Presumably they mean [Ordnance Datum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnance_datum); that's not a source, their point is to talk about "what is the zero-point that this is 16 m above".[^zero-point] (In different comments they say 16 or 17 m, but I'm pretty sure they mean 16.)

[^zero-point]: [Apparently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnance_Survey) the zero point actually changed in 2016, and now things are defined to be about 25mm higher above sea level than they used to be.

On the next page, someone links to a nearby [ordnance survey benchmark](https://www.bench-marks.org.uk/bm35265) which seemingly puts the ground there at 4.563 m above sea level. (But we get 3dp precision for the height of the mark above sea level, and only 1dp precision for its height above ground level, which is sus. Probably best stick to 4.5 m above sea level, and then the Shard would be somewhat close to that unless there are steps or a steep hill in between, and I'm sure there are some nearby.) (The benchmarks site doesn't have an FAQ entry for "what actually are these things we've catalogued so painstakingly", so [here's Ordnance Survey explianing them](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/benchmarks/). I think "cut mark" just means "we marked the location by making a cut in the wall somewhere".)

Someone else on the next page says Bing Maps has an Ordnance Survey overlay. [Looking at that](https://www.bing.com/maps?osid=1f680cdc-fe2f-4342-9d6f-3fd70147d883&cp=51.505065~-0.089808&lvl=16.296453&pi=0&v=2&sV=2&form=S00027): the Shard is contained in a fairly small contour line, but that line isn't marked with a height. The next-nearest contour I can find is marked 10 (which is in meters), so this one could be either 5 or 15, making both 16 m and "somewhat close to 4.5 m" plausible, which is frankly ridiculous.

There's [this  topographic map](https://en-gb.topographic-map.com/map-kb57/England/?center=51.50389%2C-0.08613&zoom=16&popup=51.50438%2C-0.08684). It doesn't have the Shard actually labeled, but clicking various points inside its outline I can get between 15 and 20 m. I don't think there's actually a 4-6 m difference between different corners of the base of the Shard, so this seems unreliable. Points near the benchmark seem to be about 12-15 m. It's plausibly using a different zero point than Ordnance Survey?

I couldn't find any more topographic data for free. [This site](https://www.mapserve.co.uk/blog/1m-contours-launched) might help, but I'd need to register for an account and I'm not sure that would be enough.

[This pdf](https://global.ctbuh.org/resources/papers/download/2834-the-shard-london-uk.pdf) on the CBTUH website says 310 m height. There's also [this pdf](https://global.ctbuh.org/resources/papers/download/917-engineering-tall-in-historic-cities-the-shard.pdf) which doesn't give a height, but does have a ground configuration table; we have "made ground" from +4.7 m OD to 0.0 m OD, matching the OS benchmark. Other pdfs in the search result say 306 m, 306 m, and 1016 ft / 310 m.

[Wikiarquitecture](https://en.wikiarquitectura.com/building/shard-london-bridge/): 310 m.

[This drawing](https://www.archdaily.com/889852/the-shard-renzo-piano-building-workshop/5a963b40f197ccd4d00000b5-the-shard-renzo-piano-building-workshop-elevation-and-plans): 306 m.

And that's it for googling.

Oh! This is kind of embarrassing to admit, but even though I go by the Shard pretty often I don't have a good sense of the road layout near it, or indeed which building in the road layout is the Shard. (When you're next to it and not looking up, it's much like any other building.) But scrolling around street view for a bit to refresh my memory, I realize it has ground-level exits on at least two different floors, with an [outside escalator](https://goo.gl/maps/yVnw4oYVeZUzmNdq5) that's probably something around 10 m elevation. (On screen it's about 4.5x the height of that guy, so I'd guess a bit under. And I think I count 36 escalator steps, [this](https://www.oregon.gov/bcd/codes-stand/Documents/interp-03-01-escalators.pdf) says typical escalator step rise is 8 1/2 in, which makes 7.77 m.) There's also a pedestrian walkway going underneath the level of the upper street, but that's too wide to think of as a bridge. So actually, a 4-6 m difference between corners is totally reasonable; what counts as "ground level" when you're inside a building like that? Still, the topographic map disagrees with OS about the benchmark too.

I searched HM Land Registry for the Shard, but the [results](https://search-property-information.service.gov.uk/search/summary/FK75xUWBOCWk_FdaSXry9w==/lpmXy1LRLg2KrcrH4i14VA==) don't give me anything interesting. It was a long shot.

So... I'm not sure, really. My current guess is that OS is right about everything, making Maher right too. The Shard's highest point is 308.9 m above sea level. Then the only plausible value for its tallness is 306 m, making it about 3 m above sea level at the ground, which is close enough to the benchmark height that I can believe it. The Shard also has a ground floor significantly higher than that. Not at 16 m, but a combination of "confused by the two different street levels" and "using a different value for sea level" could plausibly give that number. I don't have an explanation for the 4.7 m value, but I find it kinda hard to believe anyway: it suggests that before development that ground was within 10 cm of sea level, and in particular below the nearby Thames most or all of the time. Not inconceivable, but in context I doubt.

I think the funniest way to resolve this for good, would be for someone to announce plans for a 307 m tall building with its base 4 m above sea level, and specifically claim it as taller than the Shard. The skyscraper fandom will presumably erupt into civil war, but when the dust settles we can hope they'll have uncovered the truth.
