	<h3><a href="/drafts/cliffs-notes-pttlos-part-2.html">Cliffs Notes: "Probability Theory: The Logic of Science", part 2</a></h3>

<p><em>This is a draft. Please assume that I would prefer you not to share it, unless I've told you otherwise. Comments are appreciated, but they will not be carried over to the published version.</em></p>

<p>A book sometimes cited on LessWrong as recommended reading is E.T. Jaynes&#39; <a href="http://www-biba.inrialpes.fr/Jaynes/prob.html"><em>Probability Theory: The Logic of Science</em></a>. I intend to write a series of posts reading this book, summarizing the key points, and solving the exercises. (There are no solutions in the book.)</p>

<p>The book has over 750 pages. This will take me a long time, if I finish at all. I&#39;m not committing to finishing. For example, if this turns out not to be a thing worth doing, I hope that I will notice that and stop. I&#39;m also not committing to any particular posting rate while I continue.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2: The Quantitative Rules</h2>

<p>In <a href="/2014/02/02/cliffs-notes-pttlos-part-1.html">chapter 1</a>, we formulated our problem. In this chapter, we deduce the quantitative rules for inference that follow from  ouur desiderata. To recap, the desiderata can be broadly stated as:</p>

<ul>
<li>(I) Representation of degrees of plausibility by real numbers;</li>
<li>(II) Qualitative correspondance with common sense;</li>
<li>(III) Consistency.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.1. The product rule</h3>

<p>First, let&#39;s find a consistent rule relating the plausibility of $AB$ to the separate plausibilities of $A$ and $B$. In particular, let&#39;s find $AB|C$.</p>

<p>We should be able to calculate $AB|C$ given $B|C$ and $A|BC$. If our robot thinks about $B$, and decides that it&#39;s true, then it will further need $A|BC$ to determine that $A$ is also true. But knowing $B|C$ and $A|BC$, we will not need $A|C$; that wouldn&#39;t provide useful information that we don&#39;t already know about $AB$. Similarly, we don&#39;t need $A|B$ or $B|A$: since we know $C$ is true, it doesn&#39;t do us any good to consider what we would know about $A$ and $B$ if $C$ were unknown.</p>

<p>So we should be able to write</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">$$ (AB|C) = F[(B|C), (A|BC)] $$
</code></pre></div>
<p>Of course, since $AB = BA$, then we should also be able to use $A|C$ and $B|AC$; and by desideratum (IIIa), using either of these methods should give the same results. Thus we have</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">$$ (AB|C) = F[(B|C), (A|BC)] = F[(A|C), (B|AC)]. $$
</code></pre></div>
<p>We can approach this from another direction. For example, suppose instead that</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">$$ (AB|C) = F[(A|C), (B|C)]. $$
</code></pre></div>
<p>We can easily see that this fails desideratum (II). Consider the propositions $A$, that the left eye of the next person I meet will be blue; $B$, that her right eye will be blue; and $B&#39;$, that her right eye will be brown. $B$ and $B&#39;$ are both fairly plausible given $C$, my knowledge of the human eye; but $AB|C$ is also fairly plausible, and $AB&#39;|C$ is very implausible.</p>

<p>We are trying to find $AB|C$ as a function of the plausibilities $A|C$, $B|C$, $A|BC$ and $B|AC$. There are $11$ combinations of two or more of these; for nine of them we can find an example where desideratum (II) fails. The two that survive are the ones we already found.</p>

<p>(Jaynes doesn&#39;t carry out this analysis himself, but refers us to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rational-descriptions-decisions-Pergamon-engineering/dp/0080063934/ref=la_B001HP9MS8_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394285981&amp;sr=1-1">Tribus (1969)</a>, which I haven&#39;t looked up. It&#39;s not obvious to me how this process can eliminate certain combinations. For example, there is certainly a function $G[ (A|C), (B|C), (A|BC) ]$ which gives the correct answer merely by ignoring $B|C$. We can present a situation in which $B|C$ changes, the other two remain fixed, and $AB|C$ also remains fixed; but that doesn&#39;t tell us that ignoring $B|C$ is <em>always</em> correct.)</p>

<p>Following desiderata (I) and (II), we require that $F(x,y)$ is continuous and monotonically increasing in both $x$ and $y$.</p>

<p>Now consider the plausibility $(ABC|D)$. By associativity, we can consider this as either $A(BC)|D = F[ (BC|D), (A|BCD) ]$ or as $(AB)C|D = F[ (C|D), (AB|CD) ]$. By desideratum (III), these two calculations must give the same result. Expanding $(BC|D)$ and $(AB|CD)$ in terms of $F$, we see that</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">$$ F[ F[ (C|D), (B|CD) ], (A|BCD) ] = F[ (C|D), F[ (B|CD), (A|BCD) ] ]. $$
</code></pre></div>
<p>So if our robot will reason consistently, $F$ must follow the <em>associativity equation</em></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">$$ F( F(x,y), z) = F(x, F(y, z)). $$
</code></pre></div>
<p>At this point, Jaynes proves that there is a function $w$ such that</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">$$ w(F(x,y)) = w(x)w(y), \\
   w(AB|C) = w(A|BC)w(B|C) = w(B|AC)w(A|C) $$
</code></pre></div>
<p>which we call the &quot;product rule&quot;. You&#39;re probably familiar with it already. (It&#39;s usually written with a $p$, not a $w$. More on that later.)</p>

<p>I <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/721178/how-do-we-make-this-integration-rigorous">don&#39;t understand the proof</a>: it looks to me like when Jaynes defines $w$, he uses notation that makes it look like a function $ℝ → ℝ$, but it&#39;s actually a function $ℝ × (ℝ → ℝ) → ℝ$. (That is, $w$ pretends to turn real numbers into real numbers, but in reality, for $w$ to work you also need to give it another function which <em>does</em> turn real numbers into real numbers.) The linked post on math.stackexchange has more detail (and an answer which agrees with me, but no resolution).</p>

<p>However, I shall proceed under the assumption that I have not uncovered a hole in the very foundations of probability theory, and that $w$ is a well-defined function $ℝ → ℝ$.</p>

<p>We now show that if $A|C$ is certain, we must have $w(A|C) = 1$: because in this case $A|BC = A|C$, and $AB|C = B|C$; so we get $w(B|C) = w(A|C)w(B|C)$ for any value of $B|C$. Similarly, if $A|C$ is impossible, we must have either $w(A|C)
= 0$ or $∞$; WLOG we choose by convention that it is $0$.</p>

<p>To clarify what&#39;s happened up to this point: we know that the plausibility $AB|C$ can be determined as $AB|C = F(A|BC, B|C)$, where $F$ is some function that we don&#39;t actually know. For that matter, we don&#39;t even know the values of $A|BC$ or $B|C$, we just decided it would be a good idea for them to be real numbers.</p>

<p>We know that $F$ satisfies certain properties, notably associativity; and it turns out that as long as it does so, its precise definition doesn&#39;t matter. Instead of using $F$ directly, we can define a function $w$ in terms of $F$, and if we work with $w$ we have the product rule. $w$ also gives us the familiar rules that $w$ of certainty is $1$, and $w$ of impossibility is $0$.</p>

<p>From now on, there is little or no reason to use bare symbols like $A|C$. Instead we work with $w(A|C)$, and (spoiler alert) soon we&#39;ll replace that with the familiar $p$.</p>

<h3>2.2. The sum rule</h3>

<p>Since propositions are always true xor false, we must have that $A\bar A$ is always false, and $A + \bar A$ is always true. The plausibility that $A$ is false must depend on the plausibility that it is true. So there must be some function $S$</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">$$ w(A|B) = S(w(\bar A | B)). $$
</code></pre></div>
<p>By common sense, $S$ must be continuous, monotonically decreasing on <code>$[0,1]$</code>, and have extreme values $S(0) = 1, S(1) = 0$. Further, $S$ must be consistent with the product rule. We have $w(A\bar B | C) = w(A|C)w(\bar B | AC)$, and $w(B|AC) = S(w(\bar B|AC))$, and it follows that</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">$$ w(AB|C) = w(A|C)S(w(\bar B|AC)) = w(A|C)S\left({ w(A\bar B|C) \over w(A|C) }\right). $$
</code></pre></div>
<p>But by symmetry, we must also have</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">$$ w(AB|C) = w(BA|C) = w(B|C)S\left({ w(B\bar A|C) \over w(B|C) }\right). $$
</code></pre></div>
<p>This holds for all possible values of $A, B, C$.</p>

<p>Choose some arbitrary proposition $D$, and set $B = \overline{AD}$. Thus, $A\bar B = \bar B$, so $w(A\bar B|C) = S(w(B|C))$; and $B\bar A = \bar A$, so $w(B\bar A|C) = S(w(A|C))$. Substitute $x = w(A|C), y = w(B|C)$ and we get the equation</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">$$ xS\left({ S(y) \over x }\right) = yS\left({ S(x) \over y }\right). $$
</code></pre></div>
<p>From this, Jaynes proves that $S$ must have the form</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">$$ S(x) = (1-x^m)^{1/m}, $$
</code></pre></div>
<p>for some $m &gt; 0$. (Unlike for the product rule, I confess that I haven&#39;t made a proper attempt to follow this proof.)</p>

<p>This was derived using the choice of $B = \overline{AD}$. Thus, this form of $S$ is necessary for our theory to be consistent; but it may be that other choices of $B$ would impose further conditions on $S$. We show that this is not so: substituting into our general equation,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">$$ w(A|C)S\left({ w(A\bar B|C) \over w(A|C) }\right)
       = w(B|C)S\left({ w(B\bar A|C) \over w(B|C) }\right) \\
   w(A|C) \left(1 - { w(A\bar B|C)^m \over w(A|C)^m } \right)^{1/m}
       = w(B|C) \left(1 - { w(B\bar A|C)^m \over w(B|C)^m } \right)^{1/m} \\
   w(A|C)^m \left(1 - { w(A\bar B|C)^m \over w(A|C)^m } \right)
       = w(B|C)^m \left(1 - { w(B\bar A|C)^m \over w(B|C)^m } \right) \\
   w(A|C)^m - w(A \bar B|C)^m = w(B|C)^m - w(B \bar A|C)^m.
$$
</code></pre></div>
<p>Jaynes says this identity is trivial by virtue of the product rule. I disagree about &quot;trivial&quot;. But to continue,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">$$ w(A|C)^m - w(A|C)^m w(\bar B|AC)^m = w(B|C)^m - w(B|C)^m w(\bar A|BC)^m \\
   w(A|C)^m (1 - w(\bar B|AC)^m) = w(B|C)^m (1 - w(\bar A|BC)^m) \\
   w(A|C)^m w(B|AC)^m = w(B|C)^m w(A|BC)^m \\
   w(AB|C)^m = w(BA|C)^m, $$
</code></pre></div>
<p>where the third line follows from the second by applying $S$ again to get $w(X|Y)^m = 1 - w(\bar X|Y)^m$.</p>

<p>That is: $S$ must follow the form that we derived for it, or our general equation fails; and as long as it does follow this form, our general equation holds true. So this form of $S$ is both necessary and sufficient for our theory.</p>

<p>Now, we have already implicitly used an equivalent form of the product rule $w(AB|C)^m = w(A|C)^m w(B|AC)^m$; and we have that $w(A|C)^m + w(\bar A|C)^m = 1$. Thus, we may define $p = w^m$, and we get the familiar forms of the product rule,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">$$ p(AB|C) = p(A|C) p(B|AC), $$
</code></pre></div>
<p>and of a specific case of the sum rule,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">$$ p(\bar A|C) = 1 - p(A|C). $$
</code></pre></div>
<p>In part 1, we noted that conjunction and negation were sufficient to construct any boolean function. Thus, these two rules allow us to calculate the plausibility of any logical proposition. For example, we can calculate the general form of the sum rule:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">$$\begin{equation}
    p(A+B|C) = p(A|C) + p(B|C) - p(AB|C). \tag{test}\label{sumrule}
\end{equation}$$
</code></pre></div>
<hr>

<p><strong>Exercise 2.1.</strong> Is it possible to find a general formula for $P(C|A+B)$, analogous to (\eqref{sumrule}), from the product and sum rules? If so, derive it; if not, explain why this cannot be done.</p>

<p><strong>Answer.</strong></p>
