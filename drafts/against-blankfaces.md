Scott Aaronson writes about [blankfaces](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5675),

> anyone who enjoys wielding the power entrusted in them to make others miserable by acting like a cog in a broken machine, rather than like a human being with courage, judgment, and responsibility for their actions. A blankface meets every appeal to facts, logic, and plain compassion with the same repetition of rules and regulations and the same blank stare—a blank stare that, more often than not, conceals a contemptuous smile.

I want to push back against this a bit.

First, one of the defining aspects of blankfacedness is their internal experience. It's someone who *enjoys* wielding their power. This is a very hard thing to judge from the outside.

I used to work in a cinema. One day a mother came in with her young child, perhaps fivish years old. She was late for a busy screening, and the person selling tickets warned they might not be able to sit together. She said that was fine, bought popcorn and went in. Soon afterwards she came back out, complaining that they couldn't sit together. She wanted a refund for the tickets (fine) and popcorn (not fine, but she insisted). The conversation between her and my manager dragged on a bit. I don't remember who brought up the police, but she at least was very confident that she knew her rights and the police would back her up if they arrived.

If it had been up to me? And if I hadn't had to worry about things like PR and "someone yelling in the lobby would ruin the experience for people watching movies"? I think I would *absolutely* have used the "no, sorry, those are the rules" move. I would have been happy to do so. Does that make me a blankface? But it's not that I would have enjoyed wielding my power as such. Rather it's that I would have enjoyed punishing her, specifically, for acting in ways that I endorsedly think are bad to act in.

Does someone's internal experience matter, though? If they act a certain way, should we care how they feel? I think yes, or if it doesn't matter you shouldn't make claims about it.

That is, if what you care about is whether someone is *acting* a certain way, then don't mention *enjoyment* when you define a blankface. And if you really do care about the enjoyment part of it - well, how do you know what someone is feeling and why? One of Scott's examples is a person he hasn't met.

I predict that if the term "blankface" takes off, no matter how much people defining the term emphasize the "enjoys" part of it, people *using* the term will not be careful about checking that. Partly I think this because Scott wasn't: one of the people he accused of being a blankface is someone he never met. But also I think that... like, even if you can tell that someone is just acting a certain way because they enjoy it, you won't really be able to capture that in your description of the events, so people will read a story where it seems like the thing making them a blankface is the way they acted.

There's a lot of potential here for a kind of (reverse?) motte-and-bailey, where the bailey is "I'm calling someone a blankface which is explicitly defined as having an enjoyment part to it", and the motte is "...but no one uses it that way, so obviously I didn't mean to imply that I know what was going on in their head".

Here's another reason someone might externally act blankfacedly: fear. *Yes, this is ridiculous, but if I admit that out loud I'll be seen as undermining my boss who already has it in for me, so....* Or, exhaustion: *this is the third sob story I've heard today. I cannot deal with feeling more sympathy*.

Given that Scott admits the term is a little dehumanizing (but it's okay because they dehumanized themselves first), I think we should care whether someone is acting this way for sympathetic or unsympathetic reasons. And if we care about that, I think we have to admit that most of the time we don't really know.

Second, I feel like using Umbridge as an example is perhaps excessive.

> The most despicable villain in the Harry Potter universe is not Lord Voldemort, who's mostly just a faraway cipher and abstract embodiment of pure evil, no more hateable than an earthquake. Rather, it's Dolores Jane Umbridge, the toadlike Ministry of Magic bureaucrat who takes over Hogwarts school, forces out Dumbledore as headmaster, and terrorizes the students with increasingly draconian "Educational Decrees." Umbridge's decrees are mostly aimed at punishing Harry Potter and his friends, who've embarrassed the Ministry by telling everyone the truth that Voldemort has returned and by readying themselves to fight him, thereby defying the Ministry's head-in-the-sand policy.

> Anyway, I’ll say this for Harry Potter: Rowling's portrayal of Umbridge is so spot-on and merciless that, for anyone who knows the series, I could simply define a blankface to be anyone sufficiently Umbridge-like.

Spoilers: the educational decrees are not the whole of it. Umbridge also sends dementors to attack Harry and his cousin. She tries to slip him a truth serum, and later tries to force-feed it to him. When she can't do that, she tries to torture him. None of this is legal[^legal], some of it is super-duper illegal, and it's not expected of her. Umbridge doesn't simply act like a cog in a broken machine. She does exercise courage and judgment, she just exercises them in villanous directions.

[^legal]: At least I don't *think* any of that was legal. I am not a wizard lawyer and this is not wizard legal advice.

(I am not, here, describing Umbridge's motivations. I think I have some idea of what they are, but I'm not sure I'd capture them very well and my feeling is they're not super relevant.)

However annoyed Scott may be at his daughter's lifeguard, I predict that describing the lifeguard as Umbridge-like is unfair. I predict, for example, that she would never take initiative to deliberately engineer a situation in which Scott's daughter nearly drowns.

I think Scott is pointing at something true, and important to know about. I worry that the way he's pointing at it will result in bad discourse norms. (It might still be net positive, and I'm not sure I could have done better.)
