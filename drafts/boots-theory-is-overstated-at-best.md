Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.

This is a compelling narrative. And I do believe there's some truth to it. I could believe that if you always buy the cheapest boots you can find, you'll spend more money than if you bought something more expensive and reliable. Similar for laptops, smartphones, cars. Especially ([as Siderea notes](https://siderea.dreamwidth.org/1477942.html), among other things) if you know how to buy things more expensive and reliable.

But it's presented as "the reason that the rich [are] so rich". Is that true? think "obviously not". If your pre-tax income is less than the amount I put into my savings account, then no amount of "spending less money on things" is going to bring you to my level of wealth.

Is it even a contributing factor? Is *part of* the reason why the rich are so rich, that they manage to spend less money? Do the rich in fact spend less money than the poor?

That's less obvious, but I predict not. I predict that the rich spend more than the poor in total, but also on boots, laptops, smartphones, cars, and most other things. There might be exceptions where rich people consume less of the thing than poor people - bus tickets, for example - but I think if you group spending in fairly natural ways, the rich will spend more than the poor in almost every group.

Maybe they spend less money on their daily wear boots, but own more pairs of shoes to go with more outfits for more social occasions. Or maybe they decide that they care about other things than lifetime cost for their daily wear boots, and spend more on those, too. (Being rich means they can *afford* to care about other things than lifetime cost.)

Apparently famous people often get comped meals, but I bet most of them still spend more money on food than I do.

I spent £500 on a laptop in 2013, and before that, £300 in 2008. If I'd gone for £200 laptops each time, maybe they would only have lasted two years each. But if I weren't a techno-masochist, maybe I'd realize that using old laptops actually kind of sucks, and I'd upgrade far more often.

Bank fees are a plausible exception. I guess the rich don't have to pay to cash a cheque, and they very rarely visit loan sharks. They do have their own costs, like Amex Platinum cards ([$550/year](https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/card/platinum/)), but maybe it's unfair to count that because it gives them rewards, I dunno.

Those are all guesses. I don't have good data on this, and I'd love to see it if you do.

For what data I do have, the first google result was [this page](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/bulletins/familyspendingintheuk/april2018tomarch2019) from the UK's Office of National Statistics. Specifically, look at figure 4, "Indexed household income, total spending and spending by component by income decile, UK, FYE 2019".

They split households into ten income levels, and look at four categories of spending. Every category is a strictly increasing line from "poor people spend less" to "rich people spend more", with a single exception where the 90th percentile of income spends slightly less on housing than the 80th. (The categories are housing, transport, food and non-alcoholic drinks, recreation and culture. The graph also has all spending, which I only weakly count as validating my prediction; and disposable income, which I don't count.)

(The source for this is the [living costs and food survey](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=8459) which seems not to be open access. It might be freely available if I register, but I don't care enough to try right now.)

I believe boots theory points towards a one component of socioeconomic unfairness. But boots theory itself is supposed to be a theory of why the rich are so rich. It's very clear about that. It's wrong. I predict that even a weakened version of it is wrong.

It may be that most people, when they think of boots theory, just think of the "being rich is awful convenient" part of it. If you don't want to put much effort into thinking about boots, being rich buys you that luxury. I have no beef with that part of it. So stipulating that that's not what people mean when they talk about boots theory, does it matter that boots theory, as originally stated, is more than that?

Maybe not much. But I think it does at least a little.

It seems to me that boots theory is usually presented in whole in its original form. Its original form is succinct and well written. When people want to comment on it, they very often include the very same quote as I did. But the original form starts by very clearly telling us "this is a theory of why the rich are so rich". It is very obviously wrong.

I get the impression that most people don't even notice this. They link or quote something that starts out by saying very clearly "this is a theory of why the rich are so rich", and they don't think that it's a theory of why the rich are so rich.

(I wouldn't be surprised (though this is not a prediction) if even the author didn't notice this. Maybe if you had asked him, Terry Pratchett would have said that no, obviously Sam Vimes does not think this is why the rich are so rich, Sam Vimes just thinks this is a good illustration of why it's nice to be rich.)

So first, consider what happens if someone sees boots theory, sees that it's well regarded, and then *takes it seriously*. They might try to solve poverty in ways that will never work at all. When they realize boots theory is wrong, they might decide that all the people who spoke highly of it had simply no clue about poverty.

But also... I'll be honest. This disconnect between what a thing actually says, and what people seem to think it says, just bothers me. I feel the desire to point it out.
