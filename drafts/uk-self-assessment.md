title: "Walkthrough: Filing a UK self-assessment tax return"
---

The gov.uk [page on filing](https://www.gov.uk/log-in-file-self-assessment-tax-return) says you have to register first unless you sent a tax return last year. I've sent tax returns for several years running now, and I don't remember what registering was like.

Logging in I get sent to my "personal tax account" page. It tells me I paid the right amount of tax for 2019-2020, but that has to be based on guesswork because they don't know how much I donated to charity or put into pensions.[^charity-pensions] I click that box and another page tells me how much they think I paid and that they think it was right, but they don't explain either number. According to my own records[^ledger] I think I paid about Â£230 more than they think I paid.

[^charity-pensions]: For charity, they ask each time you file a return how much you expect to donate next year, so they have a decent guess for that. For pensions you'd think they have some idea, because they give me money every time money goes into my pensions. But also they ask later in the process how much money went into my pensions. So I'm not sure if they've taken it into account here.

[^ledger]: I track my finances with [Ledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledger_%28software%29), so this is fairly easy for me to calculate. There's a caveat that I got a tax rebate in January 2021 for apparently overpaying in tax year 2019-2020. I marked that as coming out of the same account that I mark the tax deductions on my payslip as going in to. Since it arrived in tax year 2020-2021, I need to add that amount back in to get the amount I paid in that tax year. I could also mark it as "it arrived in my current account on this date but came out of my tax account on that date".

So I click the "complete your tax return" link in the top right box. I swear that was harder to find in the past. It explains who can and can't file a return, I assume I read that in a previous year and could then and still can, and I click 'start now'.

The first page has a bunch of stuff filled in for me, mostly accurate.

"P J" is my first two initials, not my first name, but nice try.

<a href="/images/uk-self-assessment/02.02-about-you-id.png"><img src="/images/uk-self-assessment/02.02-about-you-id.png" style="max-width: 100%" alt="screenshot"></a>

These say 'optional', which sounds like I don't need to give them if I don't want to. But up above it says

> 'Optional' indicates only complete if relevant to you

So maybe that means "give us this if you have one"? I'm probably safe to leave out my phone number, I don't want them calling me and I don't know what "STD" means.[^std] I'll grudgingly give them my email address I guess.

[^std]: In this context.

<a href="/images/uk-self-assessment/02.03-about-you-address.png"><img src="/images/uk-self-assessment/02.03-about-you-address.png" style="max-width: 100%" alt="screenshot"></a>

For years I've been using my parents' address for all official stuff, which is easier than telling banks and the like every time I move house. But some time this year I got a scary letter telling me I had to register for the electoral roll in my current place, which meant I got removed from it back in Bristol. So probably I have to give my current address here too.

(I don't see why it's any of the government's business where I live. Unfortunately they disagree, and they have all the power in this relationship.)

<a href="/images/uk-self-assessment/02.04-about-you-address-date.png"><img src="/images/uk-self-assessment/02.04-about-you-address-date.png" style="max-width: 100%" alt="screenshot"></a>

Well this is awkward. I moved in here in 2019, but I wouldn't have given this address when filling in my 2019-2020 tax return. Will they get pissy with me if I give the date I moved in? Eh, probably not.

<a href="/images/uk-self-assessment/02.05-residency-dob.png"><img src="/images/uk-self-assessment/02.05-residency-dob.png" style="max-width: 100%" alt="screenshot"></a>

That's not what "e.g." means, but the date is correct. I assume the residency status is too, I was born in England and never lived outside it.

<a href="/images/uk-self-assessment/02.06-about-you-marital-status.png"><img src="/images/uk-self-assessment/02.06-about-you-marital-status.png" style="max-width: 100%" alt="screenshot"></a>

This is 'optional', so maybe there are people who don't have a marital status, as distinct from having the marital status 'single'? Or maybe, contra what they said above, it means I don't have to tell them, and then probably they'll treat me as single if I don't specify?

The options are: Single, Married, In Civil Partnership, Divorced, Civil Partnership dissolved, Widow, Widower, Surviving Civil Partner, Separated. Obviously you can be more than one of these in any given tax year, or even more than one of them simultaneously, so the help text is not very helpful. I guess the idea is you give the most specific version of the most recent change as of the end of the tax year? I don't know who would ever pick "separated". Luckily for me, the government hasn't decided it cares about long-term cohabiting relationships until we actively make them legible, at least not for tax purposes. So I get to just say "single" and not worry about it.

This is the only part of the page (maybe of the whole tax return?) where your gender becomes relevant, and then only for widows and widowers.

<a href="/images/uk-self-assessment/02.07-blind.png"><img src="/images/uk-self-assessment/02.07-blind.png" style="max-width: 100%" alt="screenshot"></a>

If they're assuming I didn't move house, you'd think they could assume I didn't go blind or get a blind spouse or civil partner.

I wonder what counts as an "other register". I think it's a crime to lie on my tax return, and quite possibly a crime to lie to my local authority about being blind. But it might not be a crime to lie on Honest Joe's Register Of Definitely Actually Blind People, and then to truthfully tell HMRC that I'm on that register. (This sounds like the sort of thing that you [patiently explain](https://xkcd.com/651/) to a judge and then the judge adds a little extra to your fine for being a smartarse. You try to appeal and the appeals court rejects with the comment "lolno". If you're going to try this, I think the funniest way would be to borrow a guide dog to take to court with you but make no other pretense at blindness. Maybe carry a cane slung over your shoulder.)

There's nothing here telling you how to figure out if you're on plan 1 or plan 2, but I am indeed on plan 1. The Student Loan Company told them that (according to the help text), but apparently didn't tell them enough to know that I do not have and am not repaying a postgrad loan.
