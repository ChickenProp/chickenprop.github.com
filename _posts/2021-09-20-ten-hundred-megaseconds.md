A megasecond, one million seconds, is 11 days and 14 hours. (13 hours, 46 minutes and 40 seconds, assuming no leap seconds.) About a week and a half.

Ten megaseconds is 116 days. (115, plus 17:46:40.) A bit less than four months, a third of a year.

A hundred megaseconds is 1,157 days. (Plus 9:46:40[^minutes-seconds].) Roughly three years and two months - it could be 61 or 62 days depending on leap years.

[^minutes-seconds]: Why are the minutes and seconds always the same? Because 46 minutes and 40 seconds is 2800 seconds, and the remainder when dividing (10 × 2800) by (60 × 60) is also 2800. So multiply the previous duration by 10 and you get the same number of minutes and seconds left over. For similar reasons, the number of hours after hitting 10 megaseconds will keep looping: 17, 9, 1, 17, 9, 1.

I think it might be kind of nice if we celebrated a hundred megaseconds additonally-to and/or instead-of birthdays.

One thing I like about it is that humanity won't stay on Earth forever. If we go interplanetary, I think we're more likely to keep measuring time in seconds than in Earth years. I like this as a way of looking to the future.

Another thing is, it doesn't happen at the same time every (Earth) year. Some birthdays fall on or near holidays, or during seasons we don't much like, and that can make them less convenient to celebrate. If that happens to you one hundred megaseconds, it probably won't happen the next hundred megaseconds. (I think a five month offset would be better than two for this purpose, you'd never be in the same season twice in a row, but two is better than zero.)

I also just think it's kind of a sweet spot time interval? I'm old enough now that years don't feel very long, decades[^decade] do, and a hundred megaseconds is nicely in between.

[^decade]: Incidentally, a decade would be [π hundred megaseconds](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/10/14/duffs-rule/), to within 0.4%.

(If "hundred megaseconds" is unwieldy, a quick look at wikipedia [suggests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100,000,000) "yisec" from Chinese or "okusec" from Japanese. Or maybe "[myri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myriad)-myri-sec" from Ancient Greek. I think my favorite would be "hecto-megasec" from Ancient Greek via [SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix#List_of_SI_prefixes). I'm not going to try to use any of these myself though.)

Ten hundred megaseconds, a billion seconds, is 11,574 days. About 31 years eight months. (The remainder is 251-253 days, depending on leap years[^days]. Plus 1:46:40.) That's how old I turned on August 21st this year.

I didn't do anything to celebrate, partly because even though I'd put it in my calendar a long time before, I didn't remember until a couple days after, and partly because I'm not very good at celebrating things. (I don't normally celebrate my birthdays, either.) I did do some work on [Haskenthetical](http://reasonableapproximation.net/2021/03/14/haskenthetical-update-macros.html) for the first time in months, which feels like a good start to the next billion. Maybe I'll celebrate turning eleven, which will be on October 21st, 2024.

If you're interested, here's a widget you can use to calculate your age, or other intervals, in hundred megaseconds.

[^days]: It would be 259 days if there were no leap years. You'd normally experience February 29th eight times in that period, but it might only be seven if you start shortly after a February 29th. And it might only be six, if the period crosses a 100-but-not-400-year boundary.
