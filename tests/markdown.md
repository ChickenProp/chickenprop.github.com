I want footnotes[^1], including named footnotes[^here] to work[^2].

Also, lists should work, ideally:

* Like this

* where I have two lines

* between bullets

and also

* like this
* with only one line
* between points

and the same for numbered lists:

1. two lines

2. two lines

3. two lines

and

1. one line
2. one line
3. one line

[^1]: Like this
[^here]: And this
[^2]: And this
